        In India, we haven't accepted the notion of alternative education. Teaching through ppts and 
        graphs still remains a distant dream ( just copying word to word in slides from the text book 
        and dictating the same doesn't brings in any alternative education). Moreover, most of the 
        educational institutes still love to teach within the contours of a traditional classroom. 
        Theoretical knowledge still is preferred than the practical principles.

        Alternative education like use of technology will broaden the student mind. Nevertheless, 
        alternative education is not just confined to use of technology in classroom teaching. 
        Alternative education means teaching a student the art of automated process control by 
        letting him know its practical applications followed by asking him to design one such 
        model and then taking him to an industry for the on-field demonstration. All this will 
        encourage student to participate profoundly in the knowledge exchange process instead 
        of simply mugging up few designs.

        Guest speakers have become an important part of the educational experience for students. 
        They expose students to real-world life experiences from the position of someone who has 
        been there. Students get to see the insight and perspective of the guest speakerâ€™s particular field. 
        Watson family introduces student to other professions and career opportunities. By inviting a veteran, 
        author, professor, scientist, veterinarian, dentist, musician, or lawyer, our students will leave the 
        experience with more knowledge then they came into with.

        The authorized media of communication between the students and Academy is the Notice Board; 
        the students are expected to read the notice board regularly. The Institute will not be responsible 
        for any loss of the students due to their negligence.

        Damage to the property of the Academy like tampering with fixtures, will be viewed seriously and cost 
        of damage will be recovered from the concerned students.
