      <h2>Parent Instruction</h2>
      <p>Life is busy as students process oceanographic samples, participate in classes, stand watch in shifts during the around-the-clock schedule, and delve into navigation, science, engineering, cooking, and cleaning.</p>
      <p>You and your child are approaching a tremendous milestone in your journey together, and on behalf of Watson, we want to congratulate you all on the love and hard work that brought you to this point. You find yourself looking into Watson, a small innovative academy that has caught either your or your child’s attention.</p>
      <p style={{ backgroundColor: "#ddd", lineHeight: "1.5rem", borderRadius: "10px", padding: "1rem", fontStyle: "italic" }}>Watson prepares students to become exemplary innovators, as well as thoughtful, caring, fun-loving people. The groundbreaking schedule, a commitment to gender balance and the outstanding faculty, staff and students create a culture that fosters collaboration, respect, curiosity and resilience.</p>
      <p>Watson is different. It’s probably a lot smaller and newer than the other coaching/academy on your child's list. Its alumni body is only in the few number and none of them have won something (yet). While that difference is not the norm, you might just find that for your family, different is better.</p>
